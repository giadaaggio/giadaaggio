## Hi, I'm Giada! 🌱

Hello there! I'm someone who's always been fascinated by the night sky, from childhood stargazing to recently completing a Master's degree in ✨ _Astrophysics and Cosmology_ ✨. That curiosity for the universe has grown into a passion for stars, stellar evolution, and binary systems, and today I love exploring these topics through programming and data analysis.

💻 I enjoy working on scientific problems that require both analytical thinking and creativity. I'm experienced with Python and LaTeX, and I’ve worked with astronomical catalogs and UV/optical photometric data—always aiming to turn complex data into meaningful insights.

🪐 I'm passionate about space science, and I also love exploring how technology (especially in the Apple ecosystem) helps us connect, create, and discover.

🏔️ Outside of work, I’m a big music lover: you’ll often find me coding with a playlist in the background! I also care about sustainability, I enjoy reading, caring about my plants and feel most alive when I’m in the mountains, whether hiking or simply soaking in the quiet.

🍄 I'm always open to learning something new, collaborating on exciting projects, or just connecting with people who share similar passions. Thanks for stopping by!
