## Hi, I'm Giada!

Hello there! I'm someone who's always been fascinated by the night skyâ€”from childhood stargazing to recently completing a Master's degree in âœ¨Astrophysics and Cosmologyâœ¨. That curiosity for the universe has grown into a passion for stars, stellar evolution, and binary systems, and today I love exploring these topics through programming and data analysis.

ðŸ’» I enjoy working on scientific problems that require both analytical thinking and creativity. I'm experienced with Python and LaTeX, and Iâ€™ve worked with astronomical catalogs and UV/optical photometric dataâ€”always aiming to turn complex data into meaningful insights.

ðŸš€ I'm passionate about space science, and I also love exploring how technology (especially in the Apple ecosystem) helps us connect, create, and discover.

ðŸŽµ Outside of work, Iâ€™m a big music loverâ€”youâ€™ll often find me coding with a playlist in the background. I also care about sustainability, enjoy reading, and feel most alive when Iâ€™m in the mountains, whether hiking or simply soaking in the quiet.

ðŸŒ± I'm always open to learning something new, collaborating on exciting projects, or just connecting with people who share similar passions. Thanks for stopping by!
