## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology, driven by a deep curiosity for the universe and a passion for exploring it through science and programming. My academic journey has equipped me with strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and solid experience in scientific coding and data analysis.

ðŸŒŸ Iâ€™m especially interested in stars, stellar evolution, and binary systems, and I enjoy working on problems that combine physics, data, and computational tools to better understand the cosmos. I have a solid working knowledge of Python and LaTeX, and I'm experienced in astronomical catalog building and the analysis of UV and optical photometric data.

ðŸš€ I'm passionate about space science and how technology can be used to explore complex systems. I love staying up to date with new innovations, and Iâ€™m always curious about the latest tools and platforms shaping our digital world.

ðŸŽµ Outside of science, music plays a big role in my lifeâ€”whether it's discovering new artists, going to concerts, or simply getting lost in a playlist while coding. ðŸ“š Iâ€™m also passionate about reading and sustainability, and I find peace and energy in the mountains: hiking, exploring, or just being surrounded by nature.

ðŸŒ± I'm now looking forward to new challenges and opportunities where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and contribute to meaningful and inspiring projects.
